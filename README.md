# realtimeobjectdetection
This program helpts to detect real time object frames and it will tell via speaker what is detectd in frame.
Remindre: If you deploy this in streamlit cloud community it will not work because the application can be deployed on Streamlit, but real-time webcam and voice output are supported only in local deployment due to cloud environment restrictions.
so if you work with this in your local environment it will work.
